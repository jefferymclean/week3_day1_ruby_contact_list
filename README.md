============================
### Ruby Contact List App

This is an application I wrote in Week 3 at Lightohuse Labs. It allows the user to add, edit and delete contacts from within the command line. This is great for developers and all...but we decided it would be more useful on the web. So, the next day, I converted it into a web app so the user could use it from their browser.
